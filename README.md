# Guidelines ðŸª„

- No framework or tool like Bootstrap or similar
- Use modern CSS properties for general, but especially in the construction of your layout, such as Flexbox or CSS Grid.
- As far as possible, try to make a modular development. Therefore, if you use SASS as your CSS pre-processor, all the better.
- The choice of fonts is at your discretion, just try to make them as similar as possible to the design.

âœ¨ We love teamwork. Take into account the best development practices regarding collaborative work.
